# Branches

This project was done by Shishir, Lydía and myself (Erla).

I acted as the "mother" and made a new repository. Shishir and Lydía forked and cloned it and made some small changes to the code. I pulled it in and merged so the code would all come together.

Then I invited them as collaboraters and they made their own branches. The each made changes to the code which I then pulled and merged.

We did have some problems with Lydía's branches at first, the branches didn't seem to update but we managed to solve it in the end (honestly no idea what caused or fixed the problem, though).
